 * @class BoundaryMesh
 * @brief Represents boundaries of an unstructured mesh.
 *
 * The BoundaryMesh class stores information about the boundary faces and their
 * properties in an unstructured mesh. It provides access to various fields such
 * as face cells, face centers, face normals, face areas normals, magnitudes of
 * face areas normals, delta vectors, weights, delta coefficients, and offsets.
 *
 * Boundary faces are organised such that regular boundaries are stored first, followed
 * by the processor boundaries.
 *
 * The class also provides getter methods to access the individual fields and
 * their components.
 *
 * @tparam Executor The type of the executor used for computations.
