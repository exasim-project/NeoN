 * @class UnstructuredMesh
 * @brief Represents an unstructured mesh in NeoN.
 *
 * The UnstructuredMesh class stores the data and provides access to the
 * properties of an unstructured mesh. It contains information such as mesh
 * points, cell volumes, cell centres, face areas, face centres, face owner
 * cells, face neighbour cells, and boundary information. It also provides
 * methods to retrieve the number of cells, internal faces, boundary faces,
 * boundaries, and faces in the mesh. Additionally, it includes a boundary mesh
 * and a stencil data base. The executor is used to run parallel operations on
 * the mesh.
