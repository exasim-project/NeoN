Welcome to NeoN!
===================

The NeoN project has set itself the goal of using modern software development methods for the development of open-source CFD software.
It is:

* platform portable and GPU ready;
* compliant with modern C++20;
* extensively unit-tested;
* highly extensible via plugins

We aim for an easy integration other with CFD frameworks by providing a simple, yet powerful API.
NeoN is a community-driven project and we welcome contributions from everyone.
